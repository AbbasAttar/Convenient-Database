# Convenient-Database

## Reason for creating this project 

Database are easy to make but hard to update. 

Similar case occured in my college, when data of our seniors about "which company they are working" and "on what post they are currently" this data was getting tough to manage as they didn't have any convinient way to update their status.

So my solution for this problem was to Create a **Database updating program with whatsapp message**


## How this works.

I used Twilio to get whatsapp message directly to my python app which inturn updated database.
